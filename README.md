## TeamCity CVE-2023-42793 Exploit

This Python script exploits a security vulnerability (CVE-2023-42793) in JetBrains TeamCity, allowing an attacker to  create a new user with administrative privileges.

### Usage
The script takes either a single TeamCity instance URL or a list of URLs as input. The provided URL(s) should point to the TeamCity server(s) that are vulnerable to CVE-2023-42793.
z
#### Single URL:
```bash
python exploit.py -u http://teamcity.example.com
```

#### List of URLs:
```bash
python exploit.py -l url_list.txt
```

### Dork:
- Google: `intitle:"log in to teamcity"`
- Shodan: `http.component:"TeamCity"`
- Shodan: `http.title:"Log in to TeamCity -- TeamCity"`
- Shodan: `http.title:TeamCity`

### How it Works
1. **Token Deletion**: The script initiates a DELETE request to remove the user token associated with the default user (id:1).
2. **Token Creation**: Upon successful token deletion, a new user token is created for the same default user.
3. **User Creation**: Using the newly generated token, the script then creates a new user with administrative privileges.
4. **Output**: Successful exploits are reported, and the compromised URLs are appended to a file named `vulnerable.txt`.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
